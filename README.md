## 🚀 About Me

I'm Gordon, a data-driven analyst with a passion for gaming, emerging tech, and digital consumer behavior. Just graduated with my Master’s in Business Analytics at USC Marshall, I’ve had the opportunity to work on impactful projects across **A/B Testing**, **Product & Game Operations**, and **BI Analytics**.

My background spans internships at **Tencent Games (Supercell & Level Infinite)** where I analyzed large-scale user behavior, campaign performance, and monetization strategies for some of the world's most engaging games. I also keep training my technical skills and product business sense across **Marketing Campaign**, **A/B Testing**, **Data Pipeline**, and **Business Intelligence** projects

I love connecting the dots between data and storytelling—using tools like **Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Statsmodels), SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Excel (Pivot Table, VBA, VLOOKUP), Power BI, Tableau, Snowflake, and dbt** to uncover insights and drive better decisions.
